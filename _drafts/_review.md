  They ask you to review a project; how do you do
  that, what do you pay attention to, how your
  report will like?

A few years ago I wrote about
[independent technical reviews]({% pst 2014/dec/2014-12-18-independent-technical-reviews %})
any software project must regularly go through in order
to make sure everything is under control. I even
[said recently]({% pst 2017/nov/2017-11-21-trust-pay-lose %})
that there could be no excuse for not doing them. Moreover, the more
we trust programmers, the higher the necessity to review their projects regularly.
Here is a short summary of what a report from a reviewer must include.

I tried to touch this subject in a few recent talks:
[Make Customers Trust You](https://youtu.be/oiNI2jF46h0) at [BDMSummit 2017](http://bdmsummit.com/yegor-bugayenko-2017s/),
[How to Be Honest and Keep a Client](https://youtu.be/Rip_04Bv3Jk) at [PMCon Kharkiv 2017](http://pmcon.dev-pro.net/),
and
[How to Avoid Outsourcing Disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLk_5BmgTVk) at [Kyiv Outsourcing Forum 2017](http://outsourceforum.org/).
Also, there were a number of blog posts about that, including
[Seven Deadly Sins of a Software Project]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-08-deadly-sins-software-project %}),
[How to Avoid a Software Outsourcing Disaster]({% pst 2015/may/2015-05-21-avoid-software-outsourcing-disaster %}),
and
[Software Outsourcing Survival Guide]({% pst 2015/jun/2015-06-15-software-outsourcing-survival-guide %}).
Here is finally a more or less complete list of things a good report must include.

Basically, it's a list of questions a reviewer must answer.
When all answers are collected, the report is ready.
Most important questions are at the top.

  * The release procedure is documented, automated, and works?
  * Releases happen frequently, at least once a week?
  * How big is the technical debt (things the "eventually" should be fixed)?
  * The delivery pipeline is strong enough to reject mistakes?
  * How clean is the code? How many [anti-patterns]({% pst 2016/feb/2016-02-03-design-patterns-and-anti-patterns %})?
  * Bugs and features are registered as [tickets]({% pst 2014/nov/2014-11-24-principles-of-bug-tracking %})?
  * The code base is covered by unit tests, and coverage is visible?
  * "Work for Hire" agreements are signed with all developers?
  * Key architectural technical decisions are documented?
  * Static analysis is in place and is [mandatory]({% pst 2018/jan/2018-01-16-educational-aspect-of-static-analysis %}) for new changes?
  * Continuous integration is in place, its reports are taken into account?
  * Master branch is [read-only]({% pst 2014/jul/2014-07-21-read-only-master-branch %})?
  * Programming metrics are collected and reviewed regularly?
  * The source code repository is under customer's ownership and control?
  * Requirements documentation is short and up to date?
  * Key classes, methods and functions have in-code documentation?
  * The source code repository is garbage free?
  * UI/UX interfaces are documented?
  * Production logs are visible and regularly reviewed?
  * How responsive the team is to the tickets?
  * Revision control system has a clear history of documented changes?

Essentially, this is a very short compilation of the most important things
you can find in [CMMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration).
They require this and a large list of other things on top of that. But a small
project doesn't need everything they ask you to have. My list is shorter
and, I'm sure, will be just enough for most of you.

By the way, you can see the reports volunteers create for the participants
of my [Software Quality Award](/award.html). They analyze open source projects
and briefly report the problems found. I believe, they are trying to answer
to exactly the same set of questions.
