  Silicon Valley is a place with a lot of problems,
  which I explained in one of my recent blog posts;
  however, it's a great place to be in, for a number of reasons.

You remember my blog post about
[_Why I Don't Want to Live in Silicon Valley_]({% pst 2018/dec/2018-12-18-silicion-valley-criticism %}),
don't you? Read it first if you haven't, as of yet. The gist of it is
that Silicon Valley is a place with a lot of troubles. Noone should want
to live there, according to that article of mine, right? This is what
many of my readers concluded and they were wrong. Despite the problems,
the place is definitely unique and there are a lot of reasons why
you may want to consider it as a great place to live in, for a few years
at least, especially if you are in tech business.

I lived there for about five years and speak from own experience:
[it is]({% pst 2018/dec/2018-12-18-silicion-valley-criticism %})
distasteful, insanely correct, unappetizing, insane, positive,
shallow, dangerous, expensive, boring, and conservative. However, aside from
that:

## It Is Rich

The state of California is the biggest generator of GDP in the US, almost
[80% larger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_between_U.S._states_and_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29)
than Texas, which is the second one in the list, mostly thanks
to Hollywood and Silicon Valley.
California [has more billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiasavchuk/2015/03/04/california-has-more-billionaires-than-every-country-except-the-u-s-and-china/)
than every country (except the US and China),
and half of them live in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.

You can smell money everywhere. Salaries are overblown: you can easily make
$150,000 a year (it is around $9K per month, after taxes) being a decent Java developer. Being
a part-time software consultant you can charge $200/hour and it won't really
surprise anyone.

When you move there the feelings you get out of a $100 change: It becomes
of a smaller value for you, in just a few weeks of stay in the Bay Area. Along
with that, your expectations of your own financial results go up and you
realize that you either become a millionaire ASAP or your life is wasted.
For some this can be depressive, but for others it's a great push forward.
I've experienced both.

## Is Is Easy Going

Either it's a cultural thing of the entire America or something specific
for the West Coast: They don't tend to make long-term and tight connections.
"Nothing personal, it's strictly business," seems to be the moto of most people
there. They do business with you, they may invite you to their houses,
share a lunch with you, introduce you to the members of their families, and
then ... forget your name once the business is over. This attitude may look cold and
rude to someone with a sensitive soul, but if you are focused on doing
business and making money, you will feel way more comfortable than in,
say, Russia.

You won't need to build a sophisticated relationship before someone can
do business with you, like it happens, for example, in Europe. In America
they are ready to shake hands at the first meeting, but they are also
ready to walk out of the deal, very quickly, when business interested are
changed.

## It Is Work Focused

Try to visit any Starbucks in the Bay Area, at, say 11pm (if it's open).
There will be many people (if not most of them) with laptops. I haven't
seen anything like that in any place in the world and I've been in dozens
of them. Americans work and they work a lot. How productive they are---is
a different story---but the smell of work is everywhere.

For me it is very motivating, maybe because I'm a workaholic too. In, say,
Amsterdam, where I lived for a few years, coffee shops are crowded by people
who are chilling, talking, drinking, smoking, and enjoying life. When you open
you laptop in an honest attempt to work for a few hours you feel that you
are an outsider, you are not in the system, you are doing something wrong,
mostly likely your efforts won't get you anywhere, since everybody around
you are 1) half-drunk and half-high, and 2) seem to be doing fine. In a few
days you ask yourself whether you are doing the right thing? Maybe to be
successfull you also should join them and close your laptop?

In Silicon Valley you get the opposite feeling. If you don't open the laptop
you quickly realize that you are an outsider, you are doing something wrong,
you are missing your opportunities, you need to catch up immediately, until
it's too late. I even made an Instagram photo to illustate that, check it out.
It's a regular cafe, a regular day, a regular crowd. It's not a tech co-working,
it's a place where people are supposed to drink coffee. Have you seen anything
similar in any other places in the world? Tell me where.

## It Is Smart

Maybe "smart" is not the right word here, but I didn't manage to find
a better one. They are narrow-minded and properly educated---this seems
to be the most accurate description of what I felt there. First, they are
very tightly locked in their "knowledge frames"---they know what they know
and are not interested to hear anything about anything else, which may
disturb their self-confidence in the body of knowledge they already posess.
Anything that even slightly contradicts with the concepts they learned in school is
a "conspiracy theory" and, if you take it seriously, "You are a weird
individual and we have to agree to disagree, bye!"

On the other hand, they are properly educated in the areas they need in order to do
their work. Maybe thanks to Stanford, probably the best high school in the
world, or maybe it's just an American thing: stay focused on what you need
and renounce everything else as "informational noise." This is what they seem
to be doing: they may not know where Australia is or who exactly
was Che Guevara, but they learn what matters for them.

That's why the first impression is that they are stupid. But later you realize
that they simply have a different attitude to information: it's a tool for them,
not a source of fun. What is the source of fun for them? I have no idea.

## It Is Comfortable

First, of course, the climate. It's amazing. It's one of the best in the world,
according to ... It's warm...

Second, it's very spacious. The roads are wide and easy to navigate. The
traffic is mild (except a few highways in rush hours). Parking lots are huge
and the parking is toll-free (except SF down town). After crowded Europe
you feel it like a paradize: a very relaxed territory of comfort.

Third, the public transport there is pretty good. It's not perfect, as many
say, but for me it was pretty cool. The train goes every 20-30 minutes and takes
you to the city (if you live in the Valley) in less then half an hour. You can
even ride a bike everywhere, like I did for almost a year, even though
the territory is rather big: thanks to the CalTrain.

## It Is Democratic

They say, California is the most democratic state, and it seems to be true.
You can feel it by they way people dress, live, and don't show off, even
though some of them are pretty rich. You can easily meet a billionaire
in a coffee shop in the morning, and they won't be accompanied by bodyguards
or a cortege of armed vehicles.

No big visual differences between poor and rich

No need to dress up

## It Is Immigrant-Friendly

## It Is Healthy

## It Is Motivating
