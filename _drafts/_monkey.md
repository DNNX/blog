Remember the famous article
[_Who's Got the Monkey?_](http://hbr.org/1999/11/management-time-whos-got-the-monkey/ar/1)
The gist of it is simple: good managers always makes their subordinates
responsible for their own results. When they attempt to send the monkey back
to the manager's shoulders by making excuses, the manager has to be on alert and
not accept the monkey, always keeping workers fully accountable and responsible
for what they are doing. It's a terrific principle, but it doesn't work for most
managers. Here is why. Let me tell you a story.

{% jb_picture_body %}

I was having a dinner yesterday with a friend of mine, long after work hours,
when she suddenly exclaimed "Damn, I forgot it!" and ran away. When she
came back in half an hour I wondered what happened. She said that her marketing
team of two guys were at an expo in another country and asked her
to help them upload some videos to their YouTube channel. They needed
those videos for the upcoming conference next morning and she was the only
one who had access to the channel. I didn't get all the technical details, but
asked her why she worried so much about it. She said that if she would not
help them, they would not be able to complete their expo mission properly,
which would mean a failure for her, a co-founder of the startup. It sounded
like this, literally:

> Me: "Why do you have to worry?" Her: "It's my startup, duh!"

Here is what happened in "monkey" terms:

She _delegated_ them the expo job and gave them the monkey (responsibility). They
asked her to help them and sent the monkey _back_ to her. She was sitting
with the monkey on her shoulders while having a dinner with me. It was only
a matter of luck that she did remembered it. If she wouldn't, the expo
job would be failed. Who would be guilty? Her. They would have a perfect
excuse: "We asked you for help and you forgot, don't blame us!"

I've seen many similar stories, haven't you?

To be honest, professional employees should
[always]({% pst 2018/apr/2018-04-17-how-to-be-lazy %}) do everything possible to
send monkeys back to their bosses. Only those
[slaves]({% pst 2015/oct/2015-10-06-how-to-be-good-office-slave %}) who are junior and incompetent
always try to do everything
[the boss says]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-26-happy-boss-false-objective %}), making no attempts
to "fight back" and win some space for excuses. Seasoned experts
[know how]({% pst 2017/aug/2017-08-01-how-to-manage-a-manager %})
to manage their <del>owners</del> managers. Thus, those two expo guys did
everything right. The mistake was on the co-founder's side:

She didn't make them worry _enough_.

The result of the expo was very important for her and she was expecting it.
She hired two guys to attend the expo and bring back some leads or whatever
they had to bring back. She explained them how important it was. However,
obviously, it was not enough.

They still worried _less_ than her.

That's why they were not calling her every minute asking for the videos
they needed. That's why they didn't plan it all properly upfront and left
it till the last moment. That's why she was the only one worring.

By "worry" I mean two things going together---rewards and punishment---even though some people
prefer to call them consequences. No matter how you call them, there are
both positive and negative things to happen, if you succeed or fail. My friend,
the co-founder, knew very well what will be the reward if the expo goes well,
and what will be the punishment, for her personally, if the expo fails. However,
she didn't transfer these two things to her employees _proportionally_.

As she explained me, they were getting [monthly salaries]({% pst 2015/jul/2015-07-21-hourly-pay-modern-slavery %})
and some bonuses for each lead they bring back. When I asked about the absolute
amounts, she told me that bonuses are much smaller than the salary,
"_of course_." How can we expect them to worry about the leads, if we
clearly demonstrate them our priorities: salary first, results second.

This is what was wrong.

The job of a _leader_ is to decompose a larger objective into smaller ones
and delegate them to subordinates. An objective means the _consequences_
those subordinates will have to face when they either fail or succeed. However, what
happens in most cases: leaders decompose and delegate the scope of work, but forget
to decompose and delegate the consequences. Monthly salaries are _not_ the
right way to delegate consequences. Moreover, it is a very wrong way, because
it sends a [false message]({% pst 2019/may/2019-05-28-trust-or-not %}) to subordinates:
you are doing great until I fire you, and there is nothing in the middle.

Most likely they won't be fired for the missed video. Moreover, they got
a good excuse: "We asked you to help us and you forgot; Where is our paycheck?"

Simply put, good managers know how to make the suffering of their
subordinates more hurtful to them than the mistakes them make are
hurtful to the project. The same is true about the rewards.

Of course it's impossible to put the blame for the entire business failure
on a single employee, as well as it's impossible to reward a single
employee for an overall success of the company. But it's necessary to make
all team members win and lose _proportionally_.

Otherwise, it's not a team.
