{% badge /images/about/yegor-speaking.jpg 300 %}

[**Yegor Bugayenko**](/) is a famous software development expert, a book writer,
a blogger, a conference speaker, and a CEO of [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com), AI software company.
He is the inventor of [Elegant Objects](https://www.elegantobjects.org) paradigm of object-oriented
programming, which radically improves the quality of code and makes
it more readable and maintainable. His [books](/books.html) collect five-star reviews
on Amazon for the last four years. He is managing a team of over
300 programmers and is an active open source [contributor](https://github.com/yegor256), writing
in Java, Ruby, JavaScript and PHP.

Aside from his [regular speaking](/talks.html) at international software conferences,
he, once in a while, trains programmers in their offices. You have a chance
to see him in your office with one of these trainings:

  * &#35;1: "Object-Oriented Programming Done Right"<br/>
    Why classes get so big and turn into spaghetti code? What's wrong with
    inheritance and what is the alternative? Why NULL is considered a bad practice
    and why we still use it? What immutability has to do with OOP and where
    does it help? What SOLID and SRP principles teach us and where they are wrong?
    Why getters and setters are a bad practice and what should we use instead?
    Why the majority of design patterns are wrong and which one are valid?

  * &#35;2: "DevOps Done Right"<br/>
    Why continuous integration doesn't work even through it's configured
    correctly? Why releases are delayed? Why production servers are regularly
    down, even though testers confirm the product is OK? Why cloud services
    are not used yet, even though everybody understands their importance?
    Why branches in Git are not used, and what is the right way to use them
    in a co-located team?

Your teams absolutely needs one of these one-day on-site trainings, if you experience
problems with the quality, if your code is not as good as you expect it to be,
if your programmers are not motivated enough and you are losing the best of them,
or your DevOps processes are lacking stability. No matter what are your specific problems,
a one-day discussion will seriously boost the performance of the team. This
is the investment you make in your people, which will come back ten fold.

The price: $3,600 (plus travel expenses).

The duration: 6 hours.
